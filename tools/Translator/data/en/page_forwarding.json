We integrate many third-party international logistics providers to offer parcel delivery services for purchased goods, but we do not bear the risks caused by customs policies and uncontrollable factors in cross-border logistics, such as confiscation, damage, loss, and peak delivery delays , among others. We will assist you in risk estimation and reduce the probability of loss by providing timely risk reminders and constantly improving logistics insurance."
